		<h1> Project Objective </h1>
		    Our project uses embedded operating systems to recreate the classic <i>Ratatouille</i> scene where Remy the rat pulls on Linguini the chef's
		    hair in order to control his arm movements and cook the perfect dish. Instead of being controlled by the rat, our project will allow
		    the rat's silhouette in the hat to mimic the motion of the wearer using servo motors, IMU sensors, and Bluetooth. The goal is to make
		    it seem as if there is a real rat inside the hat controlling the chef's every move!

		<h1> Introduction </h1>
		<p> Ratatouille hat in real life. In the 2007 Pixar film Ratatouille, Remy the rat controls Alfredo Linguini’s hand movements via pulling strands of hair on his head. Hiding underneath Linguini’s chef’s hat, Remy guides the talentless chef to cook up many tasty dishes.
                            <br>As untalented chefs, we recreated the hat from the movie in hopes of getting the same experience of being controlled by Remy. 
                                The chef only needs a few pieces of equipment to start cooking: two wristbands and a chef's hat. As the Bluetooth-connected Raspberry Pi 4 inside the hat receives IMU measurements from the two Raspberry Pi Zeros attached to the wristbands, the rat's arm movements will be in sync with those of the chef.
                                The silhouette of the hardworking rat moving its arms will be visible while <em>you</em> are cooking!

		<h1> Design and Testing </h1>
			<p> We divided the project into 3 distinct components: gyroscopes, Bluetooth, and Servo motors. We individually implemented and tested each of these components
				to ensure their functionality before incrementally integrating them into our final prototype.
			</p>
		    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/drawing.jpg" alt="Blueprint" width=30% height=auto />
		    <br>
		    <br>
		<h2> Gyroscope </h2>
		    <p> 
			    We received two IMUs from Prof. Skovira, which had 6 degrees of freedom. The code we used to read in the measured data from the 
			    IMUs can be found in the References section of this website. Although we were able to print the measured data on the terminal
			    window without any error, the values seemed to be inconsistent; they did not have any pattern even when we moved the IMU in 
			    one direction. In addition, we observed that the connections between the IMU and the Raspberry Pi 0 board are often disconnected
			    and stopped the program by throwing an error, which we temporarily fixed by implementing a try-except statement and thus skipping
			    the measurement whenever the connections become loose.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    To fix the inconsistency problem, we searched up the manufacturer’s website on the Internet, and found an Arduino version of 
			    the code written by the manufacturer. We were able to borrow an Arduino Uno board from Prof. Skovira and test if the inconsistency 
			    is resulting from our RPi code or the IMU. We observed that the measurements were consistent when we ran the Arduino code, so we 
			    could conclude that the source of error must be from the RPi code. We soon realized that the IMU was measuring the angular velocities 
			    and not the angles, and added the conversion logic to our code.
		    </p>
		    <code> 
			    np.arctan2(accel_data['y'], accel_data['z']) * 180/np.pi
		    </code>
		    <br><br>
		    <p>
			    After adding this logic to the code using the numpy library in Python, the RPi code worked in the same way as the Arduino 
			    code was working. We also found out that the loose connections were originating from the soldered pins on the IMU, so we 
			    resoldered the pins to fix the problem. The measurements became consistent and stable after fixing all the issues, and we 
			    were able to move onto the next part of our project.
		    </p>
		    <br>
		    <h2> Bluetooth </h2>
		    <p>
			    One of the most important parts of our project was the bluetooth connections. We first learned basic bluetooth commands in Linux, 
			    such as bluetoothctl, discoverable on, pair on, etc. Then we downloaded the Blue Dot package and used their sample code to establish 
			    a connection between one of the RPi 0s and the RPi 4. However, we ran into a problem in which it gave an error message that says the 
			    bluetooth connection already exists, even though we turned off the pairing. We consulted with another group (Jonas Funk and Antti Meriluoto) 
			    in class; they were also using bluetooth between a RPi 4 and a RPi 0, and they recommended using a different bluetooth library called PyBluez. 
			    We were able to use their send/receive code and modify it for our project. Most of the work was done by the Bluez package, so we could 
			    successfully connect the two RPis by including the server address (RPi 4’s) in the send.py file and enabling the server sockets and ports 
			    in the listen.py file. The send.py and listen.py code can be found in the Code Appendix section. The PyBluez package also had its own GUI 
			    to enable bluetooth and connect the devices, which made the setup process much easier.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Next, we merged the IMU measurements code into the bluetooth code so we can send the measured data over bluetooth. The data that were 
			    sent from RPi 0 were in the form of a string, and they were converted to floats on the RPi 4 side. We also included a 0.5 seconds 
			    time.sleep() delay to prevent the measurements from being transmitted too quickly, as the servo movements can be less accurate when there
			    are too many values in a short period of time.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Finally, we worked on auto-connecting the two RPis at startup and connecting the two RPi 0s with the RPi 4 at the same time.
			    At first, we thought we would need to include extra lines of code to enable the auto-connect, but we discovered that the 
			    devices would connect automatically at startup if they have been paired and stayed connected until the shutdown. To connect
			    two RPi 0s to one RPi 4, we set up two ports on the RPi 4, and stored the data in two different variables. While working on
			    this part, we faced a small problem where the RPi 4 would sometimes be confused with the two ports working simultaneously, 
			    and receive multiple values as one long string. Since each value contained a decimal point, it would fail to convert the long
			    string into a float, and crash the program. We were able to fix this error by filtering out such data; we simply added a 
			    conditional statement so that the variables would store the value only if the length of the transmitted string is less than 
			    30 characters.
		    </p>
		    <br>
		    <h2> Servo motors </h2>
		    <p>
			    We used two 9g micro servos to rotate the rat's arms. The servos had to be small enough to fit behind the rat's body; they 
			    would be part of the shadow otherwise. The servos were positional, and we mapped the angles from the IMUs to be between -1 
			    and 1 to move the servos. We also capped the maximum and minimum angles to be ??? degrees, to prevent the arms from moving 
			    beyond that angle and causing unnatural movements.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    We used the GPIO pins on RPi 4 for the servos. Since we used PWM and servos in Lab 3 this semester, we were able to reuse our 
			    Lab 3 code to set up the servos.
		    </p>
		    <br>
		    <h2> Hardware integration </h2>
		    <p>
			    We paid extra attention to the construction of the chef’s hat, since our project relied heavily on the visual presentation. 
			    We had to be able to clearly see the rat’s silhouette and recognize that it is moving its arms in sync with the chef. For better 
			    stability of the hat, we decided to create our own hat rather than buying a premade chef’s hat. We used a paper plate for the base 
			    and glued a piece of copy paper around the base to make it look like a chef’s hat. We created two prototypes, and later we found
			    having two hats very helpful, because we had to take all the parts in and out many times to adjust the silhouette, edit something 
			    in the code and test it, fix the wiring connections, etc. Since the hat is made of regular copy paper, it was easy to be crumpled; 
			    having an extra hat allowed us to present a relatively cleaner-looking project as a result.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    The shadow of the rat was cut out of a piece of cardboard. We cut out the rat’s body and arms separately so we can attach the arms 
			    onto the servos and make them move. In the movie, Remy the rat pulls Linguini’s hair to control him, but we decided to have our Remy 
			    hold a spoon and a knife in each hand. This way, it would be easier for other people to understand that the project was inspired by 
			    the movie Ratatouille, and the shadow of the arm movements will be more clearly visible.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    We had originally planned to use an LED to generate the shadow on the side of the hat. Since the breadboard and RPi 4 were already 
			    inside the hat, we added code to turn on the LED to listen.py. However, when we assembled the hat, we realized that the LED is not 
			    bright enough to make the shadow visible. We tried putting three LEDs in parallel to increase the brightness, but it was still not 
			    enough, and the silhouette still looked too blurry. We talked about this problem with Prof. Skovira, and he lent us a small flashlight. 
			    With the increased brightness, we were able to see the clear shadow of the rat.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    In addition, the RPi 0s, IMUs, and portable batteries for the RPi 0s had to be attached to the chef’s arms. We first thought of simply 
			    holding a RPi 0 in each hand, but we wanted to make the system look as similar to the movie as possible. We also wanted to hold a knife 
			    and a spoon during the demo, so we decided to make wristbands out of cardboards and velcros. By using velcros, we were able to wear and 
			    take off the wristbands, and freely adjust the wristbands’ widths when other people wanted to try our project out.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    One of the challenges we faced was to balance the hat on the head. With the RPi 4, a breadboard, a portable battery, and a flashlight 
			    being placed inside, the hat became much heavier than we had thought. Moreover, the base of the hat was a flat paper plate, which made 
			    it even harder to balance on the head. We could have put the hat on a table during the demo, but it would defeat the purpose of this 
			    whole project. To make the hat as stable as possible, we attached two strings to the base plate so we can tie them around the chin. We
			    also observed that the coated side of the paper plate is making the hat easier to fall off the head, so we cut out a piece of sponge that
			    we found in the lab and glued it onto the plate to maximize friction. With these additional parts to the hat, we were able to wear the hat 
			    during the demo.
		    </p>
		    <br>
		    <h2> Startup timing with crontab </h2>
		    <p>
			    One extra component we implmemented was using crontab to automatically start the client and server processes. We connected our RPis to a computer 
			    monitor and provided power with power 
			    cables when we were coding, but we wanted our system to eventually operate completely wirelessly using portable batteries. To achieve this goal,
			    we needed a program that would automatically run our send.py and listen.py files on the RPis after they are rebooted. We decided to use crontab 
			    in Linux for this. Fortunately, we had a chance to learn about and practice using crontab in Lab 4, and were already familiar with it. We began 
			    by creating bash scripts that run send.py and listen.py; the bash files can be found in the Code Appendix section. We then tested if the bash 
			    scripts were correctly working in a few different directories.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    We also included an automatic time-out in our send and listen code, so we can always come back to our code in case any error occurs. If the 
			    programs didn't have the time-out feature, they would run forever once rebooted, and it would be more troublesome to debug them. After ensuring
			    that the bash scripts were working properly, we edited the crontabs in the RPis to automatically run the bash scripts. We realized that the 
			    bluetooth needed extra time to be set up, so running the bash scripts right at startup did not work. We decided to put a delay before the 
			    actual code runs to accommodate this issue.
		    </p>
		    <br>
		    <h1> Results and Conclusions </h1>
		    <p>
			    Going back to our original project goals, we successfully implemented each module within the time frame that we initially set:
			    <ol>
				    <li> Read gyroscope data with RPi Zero </li>
				    <li> Send data from RPi Zero to RPi 4 through Bluetooth </li>
				    <li> Control servo motors with RPi 4 </li>
				    <li> Integrate all hardware </li>
				    <li> Finish prototype and prepare for demo </li>
		   	     </ol>
			    Our iterative design
			    and testing methodology helped us to build up our system accurately and reliably, which ultimately let to our successful integration of the Rat in
			    the Hat. One unexpected problem we did encounter was the interaction of the Pi Zero's Bluetooth module with crontab during reboot which caused us to
			    make some changes in the way we start up our system. However, we were still able to carry out a successful demonstration and bring the little rat to life. 
		    </p>
		    <br>
		    <h1> Future Work </h1>
		    <p>
			    In our current system, the server side code consists of a process that terminates and relaunches every 3 minutes using Linux’s
			    crontab feature. A better alternative would be to launch the process once during reboot, as we currently have to wait for up 
			    to 3 minutes after startup for the project to start running. We weren’t able to implement starting the process at reboot using
			    the “@reboot” feature in crontab, and we suspect this may be a consequence of the startup sequence of the Bluetooth service 
			    relative to other Linux reboot processes. One future task we will implement is to debug this issue and allow our system to 
			    start at reboot, which would make for a much more seamless startup sequence. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    If given more time, we would also add additional improvements and features to the rat in the hat, such as changing the color 
			    of the backlight depending on the actions taken by the chef, adding cooking sounds, and displaying pixel art of various dishes
			    that are shown when the chef makes the corresponding movements with their arms.
